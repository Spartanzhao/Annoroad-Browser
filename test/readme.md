here are several examples you can check:
show.list1 displayed three heatmaps, 4C analysis of three samples, two sample's H3K27ac, and gene track
show.list2 displayed two samples heatmap and  two samples A/B compartmentand H3K27ac and delta HiC of two samples below. the bottom is gene track
show.list3 showed two samples heatmpa and their loops, gene expression and log2 fold change of two samples was displayed below.
show.list4 displayed two samples heatmap and each samples LRI score and CDB booundary. 
show.list5 displayed two samples heatmap ,H3K27ac and one sample's specific structrue variation. We can see that deletion the TAD fusion of one sample. the bottom tracks are Delta Hi-C of two samples and gene track
