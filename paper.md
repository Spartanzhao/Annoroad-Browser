# Summary
Different types of high throughput sequencing such as Hi-C, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, Cut&Tag, transcriptome, BS-seq, WGS have revolutionized multi-omic science. In turn, these technologies also generated some challenges, such as how to deal with a large amount of data and how to do the integration analysis of different omics data, and after all, find the correlation between different omic data. Big data visualization thus is very important for researchers to discover useful clues. However, drawing a multi-omic track plot that reaches the demand for publication requirement is a big challenge. Current published tools we can use are WashU browsers,pyGenomeTrack,IGV tools and so on. So even though these tools can help us visualize omic datas, however, these tools have various disadvantages. WashU can only run a few species, IGV can't draw the heatmap, pyGenomeTrack is unfriendly to use. All of these tools can not compare differences between two sample's Hi-C data and epigenome or RNA data. Further more, these tools can only draw one chromosome area at the same time. If we have so many interesting areas on different chromosomes, then it will be a huge work to draw these pictures one by one.  Thus, we developed Annoroad Browser, a command line based tool to solve this issue. Annoroad Browser is a powerful and flexible tool that perfectly meets the demand of researchers who wants to do integration, visualization, and analysis of epigenetic,3D genomic, methylome WGS and transcriptome data. Besides, our tools can easily combine different tracks in any order according to user needs and generate a vector graph that fits the requirement for publication. Moreover, the picture we generated is highly reproducible. Except for heat map, all the other data tracks can change the color. Users donâ€™t need to install our package. It only needs python3.6 or above. Besides, the required packages are pandas, numpy, scipy and matplotlib. 
Among 3D genomics, there are different kinds of data we can perform such as contact matrix, A/B compartment, delta z score matrix between two samples, insulating score, TAD boundary, loops, 4C display. In addition, we can display different kinds of epigenome and transcriptome data, and calculate difference between two data then show on the track. We support to show deletion, duplication, inversion and insertion from WGS on the track. Based on this handy and powerful tool, we can face the challenge in multi-omic data analysis. For example, deletion may lead to TAD fusion, and TAD fusion can trigger enhancer hijacking and thus cause gene expression alteration. You can use Annoroad Browser draw all the pictures around deletion which is overlap with TAD boundary and longer than 10kb. Tracks can include structure varation, heatmaps of two samples, delta Hi-C, epigenome data such as H3K2ac. Based on these data, we can easily find correlation of structure varation adn 3D structure of chromosme. Further more, with the help of epigenome data, We can identify three-dimensional structural changes caused by structural variations, which in turn lead to changes in gene expression.
Here are some examples below, BxPC3, PANC1 are cancer cell line, HPDE6C7 as the control. We used three examples to illustrate what Annoraod Browser can do.

Left picture first shows three sample's chromosome interaction heatmap , top two are from cancer cell line, We can clearly see deletions compared with control at the bottom. Below the heatmap, is the 4C display of the MIR31HG of three samples which distinguished by different colors of line. x axis is chromosome postion, y axis represent normalized interaction frequence with MIR31HG promoter. MIR31HG in BxPC3 was deleted, so we can't see the data of BxPC3. PANC1 however, has much stronger interaction at the opposite position of deletion compared with control. At the same time, we can see there are also several peaks at another side of deletion. Thus, we can see that deletion lead to TAD fusion and enhancer hijacking was formed.  
Picutre in the middle shows BxPC3 interaction heatmap, below is the structure variation data. Compared with control, BxPC3 has a specific deletion and this deletion lead to TAD fusion. TAD fusion can be further identified by delta Hi-C. This picture can further prove that influence from structure varation was manily restricted by TAD. So, TAD not only regulate gene expression, but also protect the genome structure integrity.
On the right panel, at each sample's heatmap below, are the correpondense loop data. Different sample's TAD structure usually are conserved, however, their loop are highly variable. Below these data, We can see two sample's expression data, and its log2 fold change of two sample's gene expression data at the bottom. We can use this kind of joint display to identify the relation ship between loop varation and changes of gene expression.

# Statement of need
 Annoroad Browser is a python3 based tool. It can perform multi-omic visualization.  It can display, Hi-C heatmaps. delta-HiC of two samples, loops, AB compartment, TAD boundary, structure variation, epigenomic data, gene track, gene expression and log2 fold change of two samples. Besides, users can also flexibly determine the display sequence of their omic data. 

# Features
Data that Annoroad Browser can show:

- `Contact matrix` : 3D genome, especially Hi-C data is a N by N matrix, this matrix can be raw matrix or ice normalized matrix

- `Zscore Delta Matrix` : Some times we want to compare the difference of two matrix, this funciont can first do the zscore of two matrices and then do the subtraction

- `Gene track`: This function can draw the genes on its location of the chromosome which include their exons and introns

- `Bedgraph` : (Epigenomic data or transcriptome data) epigenome or transcriptome data can be displayed by this function

- `Loop`: many softwares such as HiCCUPs can find out the loop from chromomse interaction matrix. We can show the loops on the chromosome.

- `TAD boundary`: chromsome was composed by many different TADs(topological associated domain), thus we want to use this function to perform the TAD boundary

- `Structure Variation`: structurue variation include deletion, duplication, inservion, inversion. Sometimes structure variation can trigger the 3D alteration of chromosome. This function can show each type's structure varation's postion and thus, we can find relationship between 3D structure and structure variation.

- `A/B compartment`: A/B compartment is a very import concept of 3D genome. Chromosme usually have two different kinds of compartment, A compartment usually have higher gene expresion level. B compartment have lower gene expression level.

- `4C show`: 4C means one to many. If you only interest in one postion and want to know how this position interact with other areas, then you can use this function to find out.

- `Signal compare`: calculate the log2 fold change of two sample's epigenome data or transcriptome data.

Annoroad Browser can display different omic data in one picture, thus we can easier to figure out the association between different omic data. Detailed instructions can found in https://github.com/Spartanzhao/Annoroad-Browser/.
